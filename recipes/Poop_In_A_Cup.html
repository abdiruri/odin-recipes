    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>Its <em>POOP</em> in cup. Well not really but it looks like it kinda.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients to make the <em>POOP</em>:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/4 c chocolate chips</li>
        <li>1 pkg marshmallows</li>
        <li>1 stick butter</li>
        <li>6 c rice krispies</li>
        <li>1 1/4 c peanut butter</li>
        <li>1/2 c walnuts</li>
        <li>1/2 c raisins</li>
        <li>1/2 c miniature marshmallows</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps to make the <em>POOP</em>:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Melt butter in a large sauce non stick pan over low-medium heat. add the bag of marshmallows and stir until completely mixed and smooth. Stir over the 6 cups of rice krispies. Mix extremely well and quickly.</li>
        <li>Take a handful of the mixture and press into a cupcake pan molding a cup shape. I use a plastic easter egg to press into the middle to smooth it out and make it deeper than my fingers can.</li>
        <li>Let these harden for an hour.</li>
        <li>In the cleane,d same non stick sauce pan, add the peanut butter and chocolate chips, over low to medium heat and stir until conbined and melted smooth</li>
        <li>Mix in the walnuts, raisins and mini marshmallows. Stir until covered and coated well. Using a regular eating table spoon, scoop enough of the mixture into the rice krispie cups to fill without pouring over the sides.</li>
        <li>Put them in the fridge for about 1 hour and enjoy. Maybe.</li>
    </ol>
